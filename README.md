# Minesweeper-cpp

# Summary
This project is a terminal-based Minesweeper game, written in C++ language. It is developed as the Mini project for the C++ programming course.

# Compile and run
In order to run the program, you have to first compile it. The compiler used to write the project is g++ version 7.5.0, so you have to have g++ installed(using other compilers might also work just fine for you, however we recommand using g++, since the project is not tested on other compilers). 

You have to compile the main.cpp file.

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o game
```
And now the game is ready to run!

```bash
./game
```

NOTE: The game only runs with out any problems on linux. You might face some problems if you try to run it on windows, including lags and low frame rates.
